    <h3>Hi, there, my name is Vinícius Farah, and I'm only another guy... Yeah, I'm not any famous coder, owner of a really famous enterprise, I'm just another guy, nothing more.</h3>
    <br>
    <h3>So, my name is Vinícius, I'm only 12-year-old, and code for fun, I don't think coding will become my job in future, I really enjoy coding, but it's only a hobby to me. <br> Anyways, some cool things about me:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>I really enjoy punk rock</li>
        <li>I'm a very, very starter, like, I just discovered the tag &quot;li&quot;</li>
        <li>I'm an explorer in this area (coding) I wanna learn everything! Game dev, Web Dev, AI, etc.</li>
        <li>I love Nirvana</li>
        <li>I hate Git. Oh... It would be hell easier if I could pull and push projects automatically</li>
        <li>Of course, I'm Brazilian</li>
        <li>I live with my two cats, my two little brothers, my parents and my grandma</li>
